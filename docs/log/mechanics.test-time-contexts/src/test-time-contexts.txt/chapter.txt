Discuss LD_PRELOAD usage for controlling a consistent perception of time for runtime analysis.

Overload sleep and clock reads to provide a deterministic perception of time.

Access to the "real time" clock would be provided through test interfaces.
test.clock.wait(...)?
test.clock.tell(...)?

test.sleep(...) # "Real" sleep.
test.time(...) # "Real" time snapshot.
