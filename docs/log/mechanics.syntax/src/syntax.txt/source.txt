		`Syntax Roots`

Syntax processing has three primary modes: inclusion, exclusion, and capture. Nearly all
implementations of interpreters will handle these cases with minor deviations.

[ Inclusions ]

The primary syntax processing mode where expressions are structured for recognition and translation.

[ Exclusions ]

Syntax-level comments. It is possible for comments to be encapsulated inside inclusions,
but most languages can identify comments during the parse stage without special recognition
of inclusions.

[ Captures ]

Like exclusions, captures can be interpreted from inclusion expressions, but most languages
handle captures during the parsing stage. Captures are used to recognize constants formulated
from the data used to formulate tokens.
