		`Legacy HTTP Versions`

The new versions of HTTP offer the question "What is to come of HTTP 1.1?".
It is possible that legacy HTTP remains open and usable with server proxies maintaining
all versions, or that client proxies transparently lift old versions to newer ones
when the server chooses not to support text mode. Or both for the greatest durability.

The expectation of clients to wholly abandon text mode is asking much in the short term,
and when the needs of a client are minimal, text mode offers more than enough functionality
to accommodate. Dependency-free operability is superb in the case of bootstrapping software,
and text mode makes that trivial when it comes to HTTP.

However, if text mode is to be kept, should it not be updated? HTTP 1.1 has some sharp edges
when it comes to message framing, and a revision could help eliminate those issues.

[ CONTINUE Responses ]

The `CONTINUE` response introduces request-response imbalance.

[ HEAD Requests ]

The `HEAD` request requires that clients share state between transmit and receive pipelines.
That is, the response to a `HEAD` request should be the same response as a `GET` request to
the same resource *except* that it must not contain an entity body. A client needs
to reconsider `Content-Length` and other entity body related headers as there is no
entity body.

[ Quirk Preservation ]

Quirks are sometimes romanticized. Would it be preferrable to love the irritants
than eliminate them?
