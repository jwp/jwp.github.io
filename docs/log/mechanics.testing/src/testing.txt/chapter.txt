The use of abstract devices (programs) does not require that associated tests
be available in order for it to function. However, the absence of tests can
make construction extraordinarily difficult when the device reaches a certain level of
complexity as tracking the working state of features becomes increasingly taxing.

[ Evidence ]

The purpose of testing software is the production of evidence to support the assertion that the
implemented feature set is working as it is intended.

Testing programs, unit and integration, are created to make this evidence reproducible by
the author and by other users.

Reproducibility of evidence is of notable importance when the software may be
used in environments that were not anticipated by or available to the author.

applied to software.

[ Types ]

Tests may seek to analyze different types of properties.

/Unit/
	Usually, a highly focused test analyzing the behavior of a specific
	function or trait of a function. However, the acceptable scope of a
	unit test may vary from project to project.

/Integration/
	Analysis of a feature or function. Normally, a wider scope than a unit test.
	Tests analyzing some aggregate behavior with respect to the operating environment.
	Like unit tests, the scope may vary from project to project.

/Performance/
	Tests analyzing how well the software performs in the operating environment.
	While being similarly fated, the primary point of interest is a rate metric.

/Static/
	Tests performing static analysis of the sources.
	Developer defined static analysis.

/Explicit/
	Tests that are explicitly invoked analyzing functionality that may already be covered
	elsewhere. Explicit tests covers cases where expensive tests are desired to be present,
	but not normally ran.
